# Taurus Dedicated Server
The Official Taurus Unity Dedicated Server project.

This repo is dedicated to ensuring I don't make any critial mistakes to my codebase and create irreversible damage.
Just in case I try to "improve" or "speed up" code that ends up breaking many other factors.

Unity Version: 2020.2.0f1

Server Documentation: [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qzBPc6fzdyAdYlj0ry61qEzGJ3_CK29WAku-2EEkYD4/edit?usp=sharing)
This is a hobby project I come back to whenever I have time off from school or work. This is not a primary project of mine, unlike other repos on my github. So its updated very infrequently.
